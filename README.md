# Price vs Value: Indian Flights

**The cheapest flight is not always the best one.**

This project explores flight pricing beyond ticket cost by incorporating
travel time and number of stops into a Value-for-Money (VFM) framework.

The goal is not to predict prices, but to understand how inconvenience
(time and stops) is implicitly priced in the market and how that affects
perceived value.

## Key Ideas
- Price ≠ Value
- Stops are penalized more heavily than duration
- Airline strategies differ significantly
- Value depends on traveler preferences

## Approach
- Feature engineering on duration and stops
- Linear regression to estimate market trade-offs
- Value-for-Money score construction
- Airline strategy profiling and clustering
- Persona-based evaluation (budget vs business travelers)
